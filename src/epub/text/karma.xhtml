			<h3>PROLOGUE</h3>
			<p class="scene"><span class="smcap">Scene</span>⁠—<span class="direction">Room in <span class="character">Lattin’s</span> London house. <span class="character"><abbr>Mrs.</abbr> Lattin</span> lies on sofa. A picture of Ancient Egypt, showing the Nile, palms and temples on wall easily visible to her.</span></p>
			<p class="scene"><span class="smcap">Time</span>⁠—<span class="direction">Present day, evening.</span></p>
			<p class="speaker">
				<span class="character"><abbr>Mrs.</abbr> Lattin</span>
			</p>
			<p>What time is it, nurse⁠—<em>now</em>?</p>
			<p class="speaker">
				<span class="character">Nurse</span>
			</p>
			<p>Close on half-past five.</p>
			<p class="speaker">
				<span class="character"><abbr>Mrs.</abbr> Lattin</span>
			</p>
			<p>(<span class="direction">With irritability of a sick woman.</span>) Not later? Are you sure? It’s so dark.</p>
			<p class="speaker">
				<span class="character">Nurse</span>
			</p>
			<p>(<span class="direction">Soothingly.</span>) The dusk is closing in; I’ll light your lamp.</p>
			<p class="speaker">
				<span class="character"><abbr>Mrs.</abbr> Lattin</span>
			</p>
			<p>Half-past five, you said? My husband expected to be back before this. Hasn’t he come? The appointment was for half-past two.</p>
			<p class="speaker">
				<span class="character">Nurse</span>
			</p>
			<p>The Foreign Office takes its time. <abbr>Mr.</abbr> Lattin will come to you the moment he gets in.</p>
			<p class="speaker">
				<span class="character"><abbr>Mrs.</abbr> Lattin</span>
			</p>
			<p>You’re sure? I thought I heard his step.</p>
			<p class="speaker">
				<span class="character">Nurse</span>
			</p>
			<p>I’ll go and see the moment the lamp is lit. But he never forgets. He always comes in here first.</p>
			<p class="speaker">
				<span class="character"><abbr>Mrs.</abbr> Lattin</span>
			</p>
			<p>But he’s so long to-day, longer than usual. And he looked so grave, nurse, when he left. He looked worried, I thought. You noticed it?</p>
			<p class="speaker">
				<span class="character">Nurse</span>
			</p>
			<p>He <em>is</em> taken up with these politics just now. It’s only natural, considering the crisis in Egypt. But he’s always so in earnest, isn’t he? I noticed nothing unusual. The Government is lucky to have him at such a time. No one could fill <em>his</em> place. (<span class="direction">Brings lamp.</span>) There’s the lamp. Is the shading right?</p>
			<p class="speaker">
				<span class="character"><abbr>Mrs.</abbr> Lattin</span>
			</p>
			<p>Fill his place! No, indeed. Phillip understands the natives better than anybody in the world. And the country too (<span class="direction">wistfully</span>). If only I could bring myself to go back to Egypt with him. (<span class="direction">Irritably.</span>) The light catches my eye there. To the left a little. Now to the right. Thank you.</p>
			<p class="speaker">
				<span class="character">Nurse</span>
			</p>
			<p>The doctors all agree it’s best not, don’t they? The dry climate⁠—⁠</p>
			<p class="speaker">
				<span class="character"><abbr>Mrs.</abbr> Lattin</span>
			</p>
			<p>It’s not that, nurse. Dryness is what I <em>need</em>⁠—warmth and dryness. It’s something else. Egypt frightens me. I can’t sleep there. Dreams come to me.</p>
			<p class="speaker">
				<span class="character">Nurse</span>
			</p>
			<p>The doctors said it was the effect of the climate on the nerves.</p>
			<p class="speaker">
				<span class="character"><abbr>Mrs.</abbr> Lattin</span>
			</p>
			<p>Oh, I know. I’d face it if I could⁠—another winter. It means so much to <abbr>Mr.</abbr> Lattin, doesn’t it? Nurse! It’s curious⁠—it’s strange, don’t you think⁠—that <abbr>Mr.</abbr> Lattin feels nothing of that <em>I</em> feel there? I mean⁠—⁠</p>
			<p class="speaker">
				<span class="character">Nurse</span>
			</p>
			<p>Hark! I think that’s <abbr>Mr.</abbr> Lattin’s step. I’ll go and see.</p>
			<p class="speaker">
				<span class="character"><abbr>Mrs.</abbr> Lattin</span>
			</p>
			<p>It can’t be the new doctor, can it?</p>
			<p class="speaker">
				<span class="character">Nurse</span>
			</p>
			<p><abbr>Dr.</abbr> Ogilvie? Not yet. Six o’clock he was to come. He won’t be here before his time. These great specialists are busy men.</p>
			<p class="speaker">
				<span class="character"><abbr>Mrs.</abbr> Lattin</span>
			</p>
			<p>(<span class="direction">Wearily.</span>) I’ve seen so many doctors. I hardly feel as if I had the strength for a new examination. <abbr>Dr.</abbr> Ogilvie will do me no good.</p>
			<p class="speaker">
				<span class="character">Nurse</span>
			</p>
			<p>Still you will see him. For your husband’s sake.</p>
			<p class="speaker">
				<span class="character"><abbr>Mrs.</abbr> Lattin</span>
			</p>
			<p>Ah, yes, for Phillip’s sake. I think my husband’s coming, nurse.</p>
			<p class="direction-c">(<span class="direction">Enter <span class="character">Phillip</span>.</span>)</p>
			<p class="speaker">
				<span class="character">Nurse</span>
			</p>
			<p>Good-evening, <abbr>Mr.</abbr> Lattin. <abbr>Mrs.</abbr> Lattin is a trifle better. I’ll leave you for a little, but she must not tire herself. We are expecting <abbr>Dr.</abbr> Ogilvie at six.</p>
			<p class="speaker">
				<span class="character">Phillip</span>
			</p>
			<p>I’ll be very careful.</p>
			<p class="direction-r">[<span class="direction"><span class="character">Nurse</span> exit.</span></p>
			<p class="direction-c">(<span class="direction"><span class="character">Phillip</span> comes to his wife.</span>)</p>
			<p class="speaker">
				<span class="character"><abbr>Mrs.</abbr> Lattin</span>
			</p>
			<p>At last, Phillip. I’m so glad you’ve come, dear. I’ve been waiting and longing so. They kept you⁠—but you belong to me, don’t you? You’re tired, poor old thing. Come to me, Phillip⁠—closer. (<span class="direction">Stretches out hand.</span>)</p>
			<p class="speaker">
				<span class="character">Phillip</span>
			</p>
			<p>I <em>am</em> a bit late. I’m sorry, Little Child. They kept me, yes. But <em>you</em>⁠⸺?</p>
			<p class="speaker">
				<span class="character"><abbr>Mrs.</abbr> Lattin</span>
			</p>
			<p>I’m well enough to listen. You’re back; I forgive you. And it’s all arranged as you wished⁠—as you hoped?</p>
			<p class="speaker">
				<span class="character">Phillip</span>
			</p>
			<p>Sir George was kindness itself⁠—⁠</p>
			<p class="speaker">
				<span class="character"><abbr>Mrs.</abbr> Lattin</span>
			</p>
			<p>You saw the Foreign Secretary!</p>
			<p class="speaker">
				<span class="character">Phillip</span>
			</p>
			<p>You didn’t know I was such a big-wig, did you? It is important, you see, dear. The situation out there is complicated. I’ve left them in the lurch a little, and my advice⁠—er⁠—my knowledge, Sir George was good enough to say⁠—at such a time⁠—⁠</p>
			<p class="speaker">
				<span class="character"><abbr>Mrs.</abbr> Lattin</span>
			</p>
			<p>In the lurch, Phillip! How in the lurch? You’re only asking a longer leave than usual.</p>
			<p class="speaker">
				<span class="character">Phillip</span>
			</p>
			<p>There, there. I don’t want you to worry your dear head with politics. The new doctor will be here any minute now. That’s far more important.</p>
			<p class="speaker">
				<span class="character"><abbr>Mrs.</abbr> Lattin</span>
			</p>
			<p>I would rather know exactly. It doesn’t worry me.</p>
			<p class="speaker">
				<span class="character">Phillip</span>
			</p>
			<p>It’s all been arranged most satisfactorily, dear; and I’m very pleased. So <em>you’re</em> pleased with me⁠—eh?</p>
			<p class="speaker">
				<span class="character"><abbr>Mrs.</abbr> Lattin</span>
			</p>
			<p>Phillip⁠—what has been arranged?</p>
			<p class="speaker">
				<span class="character">Phillip</span>
			</p>
			<p>Sir George was most complimentary. The Government would recognise my services⁠—my long services, he called it. He even discussed with me⁠—asked my advice, if you <em>must</em> know the full weight of honour placed upon me!⁠—as to my successor⁠—⁠</p>
			<p class="speaker">
				<span class="character"><abbr>Mrs.</abbr> Lattin</span>
			</p>
			<p>Successor!</p>
			<p class="speaker">
				<span class="character">Phillip</span>
			</p>
			<p>But, darling, <em>some one</em> must fill my place. There must be a <i lang="la">locum tenens</i>, as they say in the church.</p>
			<p class="speaker">
				<span class="character"><abbr>Mrs.</abbr> Lattin</span>
			</p>
			<p>You’ve⁠—resigned!</p>
			<p class="speaker">
				<span class="character">Phillip</span>
			</p>
			<p>Dear one, there was no other way. It’s a formality, you see. I can always take it up again where I left it off. Our man in Egypt⁠—just now⁠—must be <em>there</em>. He must be on the spot, of course⁠—⁠</p>
			<p class="speaker">
				<span class="character"><abbr>Mrs.</abbr> Lattin</span>
			</p>
			<p>But six months’ leave! Surely, six months’ leave⁠—⁠</p>
			<p class="speaker">
				<span class="character">Phillip</span>
			</p>
			<p>Means the entire winter. There, there, Little Child, it’s nothing. You must not exaggerate like this. What is my work in Egypt compared to being with you. The doctors forbid you to go out. It’s quite simple: I prefer to stay with you. <em>My</em> world lies in your heart. I⁠—I can always take up the work again when⁠—when you’re better.</p>
			<p class="speaker">
				<span class="character"><abbr>Mrs.</abbr> Lattin</span>
			</p>
			<p>Resigned, resigned! You have actually resigned. Your career⁠—I have broken your career⁠—at last⁠—completely. Is it wrong, then, that I need you so?</p>
			<p class="speaker">
				<span class="character">Phillip</span>
			</p>
			<p>Hush, dearest⁠—⁠</p>
			<p class="speaker">
				<span class="character"><abbr>Mrs.</abbr> Lattin</span>
			</p>
			<p>You have paid this tremendous price⁠—and I have made you pay it.</p>
			<p class="speaker">
				<span class="character">Phillip</span>
			</p>
			<p>I wish to be always with you. That is my only wish, my only happiness.</p>
			<p class="speaker">
				<span class="character"><abbr>Mrs.</abbr> Lattin</span>
			</p>
			<p>For my sake you have sacrificed⁠—⁠</p>
			<p class="speaker">
				<span class="character">Phillip</span>
			</p>
			<p>It’s I who am selfish to tire you with all this stupid Government business. There, now; you’ve talked too much and I have done you harm. There’s only happiness in my heart. No more nonsense-talk about sacrifice. You must lie quiet and rest again. I can be always with you.</p>
			<p class="speaker">
				<span class="character"><abbr>Mrs.</abbr> Lattin</span>
			</p>
			<p>Yes, to the end⁠—my end and yours. O God! Why did I not understand before?</p>
			<p class="speaker">
				<span class="character">Phillip</span>
			</p>
			<p>You must not speak like that. Love⁠—our love⁠—knows no end.</p>
			<p class="speaker">
				<span class="character"><abbr>Mrs.</abbr> Lattin</span>
			</p>
			<p>Oh, I am miserable, Phillip, miserable, miserable.</p>
			<p class="speaker">
				<span class="character">Phillip</span>
			</p>
			<p><em>Please</em>, do not say such things.</p>
			<p class="speaker">
				<span class="character"><abbr>Mrs.</abbr> Lattin</span>
			</p>
			<p>But I must, I must. My selfishness has brought you to this last renouncement. Egypt has meant so much to you.</p>
			<p class="speaker">
				<span class="character">Phillip</span>
			</p>
			<p>Too much, Mary, too much. Egypt was coming between us.</p>
			<p class="speaker">
				<span class="character"><abbr>Mrs.</abbr> Lattin</span>
			</p>
			<p>Your work there, the great work I have ruined⁠ ⁠… ! Egypt meant home to you.</p>
			<p class="speaker">
				<span class="character">Phillip</span>
			</p>
			<p>Home is where you are, dearest, and nowhere else. You have taught me this⁠—in time. (<span class="direction">To himself.</span>) Egypt! Ah, Egypt!</p>
			<p class="speaker">
				<span class="character"><abbr>Mrs.</abbr> Lattin</span>
			</p>
			<p>I hate it. It terrifies me. There is pain for me in Egypt. An instinctive dread comes over me always⁠—something from very far away. I <em>have</em> struggled against it, for your sake, but⁠—oh, it’s so, so strong. If only you could forgive me⁠—!</p>
			<p class="speaker">
				<span class="character">Phillip</span>
			</p>
			<p>Hush, dearest!</p>
			<p class="speaker">
				<span class="character"><abbr>Mrs.</abbr> Lattin</span>
			</p>
			<p>But it <em>has</em> come between us. You love it so. And it’s my fault that you can’t⁠—your career, I mean⁠—⁠</p>
			<p class="speaker">
				<span class="character">Phillip</span>
			</p>
			<p>Dear one, whatever is, is right. There is nothing to regret. Egypt, indeed, has drawn me strangely. There is some power out there⁠—a spiritual power⁠—that has cast a glamour over me. It has been a passion with me.</p>
			<p class="speaker">
				<span class="character"><abbr>Mrs.</abbr> Lattin</span>
			</p>
			<p>My instinctive terror!</p>
			<p class="speaker">
				<span class="character">Phillip</span>
			</p>
			<p>And my instinctive love!</p>
			<p class="direction-r">[<span class="direction">They glance together in silence at a great picture above the bed⁠—an Egyptian night-scene, with stars and Nile.</span></p>
			<p>Yes⁠ ⁠… yes⁠ ⁠… strange indeed! From my earliest days it drew me. Those palms and temples, that majestic desert⁠—!</p>
			<p class="speaker">
				<span class="character"><abbr>Mrs.</abbr> Lattin</span>
			</p>
			<p>Phillip, don’t! Those stars, that river bring me sadness⁠—immense regret. I feel them always rising over me. They watch me!</p>
			<p class="speaker">
				<span class="character">Phillip</span>
			</p>
			<p>Forgive me. It was the marvellous beauty took me. I⁠⸺⁠</p>
			<p class="speaker">
				<span class="character"><abbr>Mrs.</abbr> Lattin</span>
			</p>
			<p>But it’s an unearthly beauty. And something in it⁠—lost. It’s lost to you. And I⁠—oh, but I do love you so; for ever and ever you are <em>mine</em>⁠—aren’t you?</p>
			<p class="direction-r">[<span class="direction">He stoops and kisses her. She half rises, whispering</span>:</p>
			<p>Phillip, dearest⁠—something strange comes over me. I see a lifting of this heavy English sky. I have been through this before⁠—I have done this very thing before⁠—long, long ago⁠—injured you somehow! Oh, Phillip, can it be that we have lived before⁠—pre-existence⁠—is it true? (<span class="direction">Sinks back.</span>) I think⁠ ⁠… I think I must be near to⁠ ⁠… death!</p>
			<p class="speaker">
				<span class="character">Phillip</span>
			</p>
			<p>Hush, hush, my darling. These are sick fancies only. Your brain is tired. We must not talk like this.</p>
			<p class="speaker">
				<span class="character"><abbr>Mrs.</abbr> Lattin</span>
			</p>
			<p>I <em>am</em> tired, yes; but it is my soul that aches and not my body. Phillip, I want your forgiveness.</p>
			<p class="speaker">
				<span class="character">Phillip</span>
			</p>
			<p>There is nothing to forgive. I love you.</p>
			<p class="speaker">
				<span class="character"><abbr>Mrs.</abbr> Lattin</span>
			</p>
			<p>(<span class="direction">Spiritually tortured and perplexed.</span>) I want your real forgiveness⁠—before I go. I have been suffering deeply, deeply. Curtains have been rising. I almost see. Something seems growing clearer to me. I’ve done wrong somewhere! Why have I pulled against you all these years⁠—against your work? It cannot be my love that is at fault. You’re wholly mine⁠—and yet I want your forgiveness somehow⁠—⁠</p>
			<p class="speaker">
				<span class="character">Phillip</span>
			</p>
			<p>(<span class="direction">Deep patience.</span>) All the love and forgiveness in the world I give you, Little Child. But you ask for what was always yours.</p>
			<p class="speaker">
				<span class="character"><abbr>Mrs.</abbr> Lattin</span>
			</p>
			<p>Your broken mission. You alone have the strength and patience Egypt needs. I have ruined all, all, all!</p>
			<p class="speaker">
				<span class="character">Phillip</span>
			</p>
			<p>There! I forgive you, then. (<span class="direction">Kisses her.</span>) I forgive you all, all, all. But please calm yourself. This excitement does you harm. You torment yourself for nothing. It is I who have been, and am, the egoist. All men who think their work is a mission are shameless egoists.</p>
			<p class="speaker">
				<span class="character"><abbr>Mrs.</abbr> Lattin</span>
			</p>
			<p>Thank you, Phillip, for this great gift of your forgiveness. But it is not enough. I want to understand⁠—and so forgive <em>myself</em>.</p>
			<p class="speaker">
				<span class="character">Phillip</span>
			</p>
			<p>You must rest now a little. It was criminal of me to let you talk so much. No, not another word. I’ll leave you for a bit. You must be calm to see the Doctor. It’s nearly six⁠—⁠</p>
			<p class="speaker">
				<span class="character"><abbr>Mrs.</abbr> Lattin</span>

			<p>What! The first man of the day! His wonderful cures⁠—⁠</p>
			<p class="speaker">
				<span class="character"><abbr>Mrs.</abbr> Lattin</span>
			</p>
			<p>He cures the body only. <em>I</em> need a soul physician. Oh, Phillip, I believe sometimes my yearning <em>must</em> bring him to me.</p>
			<p class="speaker">
				<span class="character">Phillip</span>

			<p>My darling, it is your body alone that is ill. Your suffering gives you these strange fancies.</p>
			<p class="speaker">

			<p>You love me too well to understand. (<span class="direction">Sighs.</span>) My illness is not only of the body. Now, leave me, dearest. I wish to see him quite alone.</p>
			<p class="speaker">
				<span class="character">Phillip</span>
			</p>
			<p>Little Child, you shall. You can dismiss the nurse. (<span class="direction">Glances at clock.</span>) It is close on six.</p>

				<span class="character"><abbr>Mrs.</abbr> Lattin</span>

			<p class="direction-r">[<span class="direction">She lies back exhausted. Sighs. Covers her face with her hands. After a moment she uncovers her face and half sits up again. She stares hard at Egyptian picture on the wall.</span></p>
			<p>The fault lies in my soul, and it comes first from there⁠—from Egypt. The river is rising, rising once again. The stars are rising too. They watch me, and they wait. They’re always watching us. O God! If only some one could make me understand! If some great doctor of the soul⁠ ⁠… ! (<span class="direction">Sinks back. Her eyes close. She lies very still.</span>)</p>
			<p class="direction-r">[<span class="direction">A big clock on the mantelpiece strikes the first three strokes of six o’clock, then stops. The door opens slowly and a man enters quietly. He looks round the room, sees her on the sofa apparently asleep, and stands still, a few feet inside the door. He looks steadily at her a moment, then glances at the picture of Egypt on the wall. He smiles gently. His figure is a little bent, perhaps. He is not a big man with any marked presence. As he smiles, she opens her eyes and sees him. She shows surprise and slight embarrassment. She raises herself on one arm. Her voice is hushed rather when she speaks. He remains near the open door.</span></p>

				<span class="character">Lydia</span>
			</p>
			<p>How you startled me!</p>
			<p class="speaker">
				<span class="character">Phocion</span>
			</p>
			<p>Were your thoughts so far away, Little Child?</p>
			<p class="speaker">
				<span class="character">Lydia</span>
			</p>
			<p>I was thinking.</p>
			<p class="speaker">
				<span class="character">Phocion</span>
			</p>
			<p>And gazing across the sea as usual. What is there so attractive beyond that dim horizon? The future or⁠—?</p>
			<p class="speaker">
				<span class="character">Lydia</span>
			</p>
			<p>Perhaps its dimness only. That’s southwards, is it not? There Egypt lies, and⁠—Alexandria⁠—you said⁠—the great, new city.</p>
			<p class="speaker">
				<span class="character">Phocion</span>
			</p>
			<p>(<span class="direction">Searchingly.</span>) Distance still haunts your eyes. Little wonder that I startled you. (<span class="direction">Kisses her.</span>) But do not speak of Alexander’s city. Our thoughts lie nearer home⁠—in Athens.</p>
			<p class="speaker">
				<span class="character">Lydia</span>
			</p>
			<p>Where have you been, Phocion? All day I’ve missed you.</p>
			<p class="speaker">
				<span class="character">Phocion</span>
			</p>
			<p>On the hills⁠—alone. I have been thinking.</p>
			<p class="speaker">
				<span class="character">Lydia</span>
			</p>
			<p>Thinking⁠—you too!</p>
			<p class="speaker">
				<span class="character">Phocion</span>

			<p>I came home by way of Theseus’ Temple, saying a prayer for our loved city and for ourselves.</p>
			<p class="speaker">
				<span class="character">Lydia</span>
			</p>
			<p>But you are weary, and your feet are splashed with mud.</p>
			<p class="speaker">
				<span class="character">Phocion</span>
			</p>
			<p>I crossed the Ilissus to be sooner home, and found it rising⁠—in flood almost. Yesterday’s rains on Mount Hymettus⁠—(<span class="direction">breaks off as she makes a sudden gesture</span>). Why, what ails you, Lydia? Do I startle you a second time?</p>
			<p class="speaker">
				<span class="character">Lydia</span>
			</p>
			<p>Forgive me, Phocion; do not notice my little weaknesses. It was merely⁠—there, I’ve often told you⁠—a rising river is an omen that causes me strange uneasiness.</p>
			<p class="speaker">
				<span class="character">Phocion</span>
			</p>
			<p>Little Child, I understand. I know your feelings. Athens herself is on edge these days⁠—and little wonder.</p>
			<p class="speaker">
				<span class="character">Lydia</span>
			</p>
			<p>Phocion, let me tell you honestly⁠—I am afraid.</p>
			<p class="speaker">
				<span class="character">Phocion</span>
			</p>
			<p>Anxious, perhaps, but not afraid. The mood of our beloved city takes you with it, as it takes us all. We all are patriots to-day. But the wife of Phocion has proved herself no coward.</p>
			<p class="speaker">
				<span class="character">Lydia</span>
			</p>
			<p>(<span class="direction">Low voice.</span>) Alexander is so powerful. Some say the Macedonian is a God.</p>
			<p class="speaker">
				<span class="character">Phocion</span>
			</p>
			<p>Pshaw! In his own land, perhaps. But Athens has her own Gods. He is a conqueror, yes; but a conqueror can only take a city, not the souls who dwell in it.</p>
			<p class="speaker">
				<span class="character">Lydia</span>
			</p>
			<p>(<span class="direction">Softly.</span>) Phocion, when I hear your words my fear melts away. Yet Athens <em>is</em> conquered. Our city trembles⁠—⁠</p>
			<p class="speaker">
				<span class="character">Phocion</span>
			</p>
			<p>Hush, Lydia. I do not like to hear you say such things.</p>
			<p class="speaker">
				<span class="character">Lydia</span>
			</p>
			<p>Who can stand against him, then? Who is there can oppose this conqueror of the Persians?</p>
			<p class="speaker">
				<span class="character">Phocion</span>
			</p>
			<p>Every Athenian⁠—every Greek who loves our city more than he fears the Macedonian.</p>
			<p class="speaker">
				<span class="character">Lydia</span>
			</p>
			<p>All Athens, then!</p>
			<p class="speaker">
				<span class="character">Phocion</span>
			</p>
			<p>All the best in Athens.</p>
			<p class="direction-r">[<span class="direction"><span class="character">Lydia</span> looks nervously over her shoulder towards the city and Acropolis. The dusk deepens. The first star shows.</span></p>
			<p class="speaker">
				<span class="character">Lydia</span>
			</p>
			<p>(<span class="direction">Shudders.</span>) Your speech is often mysterious like this now⁠—dark with meaning. Each night as twilight gathers from the sea about our city, there are footsteps on the causeway that make me tremble. No sooner has Hymettus darkened than shadows move silently over the courtyard and between the pillars. (<span class="direction">Turns and flings her arms about him.</span>) Oh, my Phocion, it is for you, not for myself, I am afraid.</p>
			<p class="speaker">
				<span class="character">Phocion</span>
			</p>
			<p>Calm yourself, beloved. I am an Athenian who obeys his unconquerable Gods. I do no more than accept the destiny they lay upon him who loves his country⁠—⁠</p>
			<p class="speaker">
				<span class="character">Lydia</span>

			<p>But if Alexander discovered you⁠—if⁠—!</p>

			<p class="speaker">
				<span class="character">Phocion</span>
			</p>
			<p>Not lost, most loving woman. If the Gods take me⁠—if I die for Athens⁠—⁠</p>
			<p class="speaker">
				<span class="character">Lydia</span>
			</p>
			<p>Am I, then, less than Athens?</p>
			<p class="speaker">
				<span class="character">Phocion</span>
			</p>
			<p>Athens is great because of women like you, Lydia. You would not see her less?</p>
			<p class="speaker">
				<span class="character">Lydia</span>
			</p>
			<p>How less?</p>
			<p class="speaker">
				<span class="character">Phocion</span>
			</p>
			<p>Less free. Liberty is the breath of life.</p>
			<p class="speaker">
				<span class="character">Lydia</span>

			<p>What is my liberty if I lose you? Your voice, your touch, your living presence here beside me (<span class="direction">embraces him</span>)⁠—I want you alive and loving⁠—⁠</p>
			<p class="speaker">
				<span class="character">Phocion</span>
			</p>
			<p>Our love has grown with Athens. On the green Cephissian banks we first discovered it, and that evening on Hymettus when the honey⁠—ah, I see it in your eyes, dear heart⁠—you remember even as I remember. If Athens live⁠—⁠</p>
			<p class="speaker">
				<span class="character">Lydia</span>
			</p>
			<p>But if <em>you</em> die! If Alexander crush you, kill you! Oh, my Phocion, this struggle against the conqueror is vain. You tempt the Gods. I fear for you and for your hopeless schemes⁠—⁠</p>
			<p class="speaker">
				<span class="character">Phocion</span>
			</p>
			<p>My schemes! Lydia, what do you know?</p>
			<p class="speaker">
				<span class="character">Lydia</span>
			</p>
			<p>I suspect only. I feel you planning dangerous things that must take you from me. Those silent footsteps on our causeway in the dusk, the shadows that pass between the pillars, the rising waters⁠—Phocion! your strange deep love of Athens takes no account of me, your little, suffering wife.</p>
			<p class="speaker">
				<span class="character">Phocion</span>
			</p>
			<p>The love of Athens is <em>ours</em>. It is the love of country that the Gods call sacred. (<span class="direction">Looks out across the fading city.</span>) Hellas, your valleys and mountains, streams and happy groves⁠ ⁠… beautiful, beloved⁠ ⁠… who would not die for you⁠ ⁠… !</p>
			<p class="speaker">
				<span class="character">Lydia</span>
			</p>
			<p>I love <em>you</em>. If you live for me, you live for Hellas even more. Athens lives in our hearts, not otherwise.</p>
			<p class="speaker">
				<span class="character">Phocion</span>
			</p>
			<p>(<span class="direction">Sternly.</span>) If a barbarian rule our dear city, our hearts are dead. It is better for my heart to mingle with the soil of Hellas than beat as the slave of Alexander.</p>
			<p class="speaker">
				<span class="character">Lydia</span>
			</p>
			<p>I love you too much to see you run on death. Your wild plot to save our city is but the Fates’ way of taking you away from me.</p>
			<p class="speaker">
				<span class="character">Phocion</span>
			</p>
			<p>Try, Lydia, to love me as I love Athens.</p>
			<p class="speaker">
				<span class="character">Lydia</span>

			<p>You ask too much of me. I love Hellas, but I love you more.</p>

			<p>Then⁠—not enough. (<span class="direction">Looks away.</span>) You make it hard for me. I see the right so clearly, but your clinging love makes me weak.</p>
			<p class="speaker">
				<span class="character">Lydia</span>

			<p>There is nothing in the world for a woman but her love. If you were lost to me, Phocion, these lips could kiss one other only⁠—the rising flood (<span class="direction">shudders</span>) of our little Athenian river⁠—or the sea.</p>

			</p>
			<p>So much the better! Since she knows nothing there is nothing she can reveal. Alexander seeks to play the generous conqueror. That the wife of Phocion accepts favours that Phocion spurns can only save us from suspicion. The Persian woman helps us without knowing it. And so does Lydia!</p>

			<p class="speaker">
				<span class="character">Paulo</span>
			</p>
			<p>(<span class="direction">Turning happily.</span>) Lucia! At last you return. My love, how I have missed you. (<span class="direction">Kisses her.</span>) It seemed so long. (<span class="direction">Examining her.</span>) You are excited! Then my uneasiness was not for nothing. Tell me. An adventure, perhaps? An admirer, <em>of course</em>! This flush⁠ ⁠… ! (<span class="direction">Laughs.</span>) Little Child⁠ ⁠… ! (<span class="direction">Teasingly.</span>)</p>
			<p class="speaker">
				<span class="character">Lucia</span>
			</p>
			<p>I’ve been but a short hour, my Paulo. And, as for adventures and admirers, they have but one name⁠—Paulo. (<span class="direction">Looks embarrassed slightly.</span>) How quick you are!</p>
			<p class="speaker">
				<span class="character">Paulo</span>
			</p>
			<p>Love makes me quick. I think I guess.</p>

				<span class="character">Lucia</span>
			</p>
			<p>(<span class="direction">Ashamed a little.</span>) Listen! (<span class="direction">They listen. The waves of the sea are audible beating against the outer walls.</span>) You hear?</p>
			<p class="speaker">
				<span class="character">Paulo</span>
			</p>
			<p>(<span class="direction">Patiently.</span>) I hear, but I do not understand. It is the water only⁠—⁠</p>
			<p class="speaker">
				<span class="character">Lucia</span>
			</p>
			<p>(<span class="direction">Lower.</span>) The rising water. (<span class="direction">Pauses, while passing hand over her forehead.</span>) Nor do <em>I</em> understand. It is my weakness, I suppose. All women have something that makes them fear without a reason, and this is mine⁠—⁠</p>
			<p class="speaker">
				<span class="character">Paulo</span>
			</p>
			<p>(<span class="direction">Protectively.</span>) For which I love you all the more. For had you reasoned you would not have married me. (<span class="direction">To himself.</span>) Strange, strange.⁠ ⁠… (<span class="direction">Recovers gaiety and turns to picture.</span>) See how it grows, Lucia. All that I scraped out yesterday I have repainted. Long before the Competition Day I shall have finished it. (<span class="direction">Enthusiastically.</span>) Look!</p>
			<p class="speaker">
				<span class="character">Lucia</span>
			</p>
			<p>The glow, the warmth, the colour⁠—you’ve caught it all?</p>
			<p class="speaker">
				<span class="character">Paulo</span>
			</p>
			<p>I hope so. But when my model <em>and</em> my critic desert me both at once like this⁠—⁠</p>
			<p class="speaker">
				<span class="character">Lucia</span>
			</p>
			<p>Dear Paulo. (<span class="direction">Sighs.</span>) And it’s so difficult for me to make five scudi do the work of ten. (<span class="direction">Shows agitation.</span>) I know, oh, I know. (<span class="direction">Excitement.</span>) Yet somehow, somehow we shall find a way. And it will be wonderful⁠—⁠</p>
			<p class="speaker">
				<span class="character">Paulo</span>
			</p>
			<p>(<span class="direction">Noticing her mood and wondering.</span>) It is you who are wonderful⁠—(<span class="direction">shakes finger at her</span>) intriguing with Fate as ever⁠—⁠</p>
			<p class="speaker">
				<span class="character">Lucia</span>
			</p>
			<p>(<span class="direction">Quickly.</span>) No, not intriguing. I am but your wife⁠—and model. (<span class="direction">Laughs.</span>)</p>
			<p class="speaker">
				<span class="character">Paulo</span>
			</p>
			<p>And inspiration⁠—⁠</p>

				<span class="character">Lucia</span>
			</p>
			<p>And critic⁠—⁠</p>
			<p class="speaker">
				<span class="character">Paulo</span>
			</p>
			<p>And manager! That is the wonder⁠—that you who fled with a painter to learn poverty like this (<span class="direction">shows bare room</span>) and this (<span class="direction">shows clothes</span>) and this (<span class="direction">touches heart</span>) should bargain so cleverly in the market-place and carry home our fish and vegetables in your coloured apron⁠—the Lady Lucia, a house-wife of the people!</p>
			<p class="speaker">
				<span class="character">Lucia</span>
			</p>
			<p>Forgetting the wine as usual, and dropping half the fish on my way! (<span class="direction">Seriously.</span>) Love makes it beautiful. It is for love’s sake, Paulo.</p>
			<p class="speaker">
				<span class="character">Paulo</span>
			</p>
			<p>(<span class="direction">Emphatically.</span>) And the work’s sake.</p>
			<p class="speaker">
				<span class="character">Lucia</span>
			</p>
			<p>(<span class="direction">Quickly.</span>) The work, ah yes, the work’s sake. (<span class="direction">Excitedly.</span>) Oh, my Paulo, what would I not do⁠—what would I not sacrifice for your advancement⁠—I mean, for your art, your wonderful great art. (<span class="direction">Confused.</span>)</p>
			<p class="speaker">
				<span class="character">Paulo</span>
			</p>
			<p>(<span class="direction">Quietly.</span>) This shall be our love’s first-fruits (<span class="direction">pointing to canvas</span>).</p>
			<p class="speaker">
				<span class="character">Lucia</span>
			</p>
			<p>(<span class="direction">Repeats low to herself.</span>) Our love’s first-fruits.</p>
			<p class="speaker">

			</p>
			<p>(<span class="direction">Rapt.</span>) When you and I float over the lagoons as dust upon the wind⁠—(<span class="direction">turns to her from picture, and lowers voice</span>) when you and I are gone⁠—remembered, perhaps, only as Paulo the painter, and Lucia his inspiration⁠—this beauty⁠—ah, that is my dream⁠—this beauty shall still shine out for the world.</p>
			<p class="direction-r">[<span class="direction">They watch the picture for a moment.</span></p>
			<p class="speaker">
				<span class="character">Lucia</span>
			</p>
			<p>I fear one thing only for you⁠—poverty. You should have <em>everything</em>.</p>
			<p class="speaker">
				<span class="character">Paulo</span>
			</p>
			<p>I have. Everything that matters to an artist, and its name is inspiration.</p>
			<p class="direction-r">[<span class="direction">Looks with passionate admiration at her.</span></p>
			<p class="speaker">
				<span class="character">Lucia</span>
			</p>
			<p>(<span class="direction">With growing agitation.</span>) You left Florence for my sake. But for me, the great Princes⁠—(<span class="direction">with an effort</span>) the Medici⁠—would have helped.</p>
			<p class="speaker">
				<span class="character">Paulo</span>
			</p>
			<p>(<span class="direction">Brusquely.</span>) We agreed⁠—(<span class="direction">pretended severity</span>)⁠—solemnly, you remember⁠—never to mention your princely lover’s name. Nothing stops good painting like jealousy, and at <em>that</em> name I see blood.</p>
			<p class="speaker">
				<span class="character">Lucia</span>
			</p>
			<p>(<span class="direction">Smiling.</span>) Our Palace is too poor to house even that thin ghost. You have no need to think of jealousy.</p>
			<p class="speaker">
				<span class="character">Paulo</span>
			</p>
			<p>No need now, Lucia. In Venice we are safe from Damiano di Medici. Now, will you sit for me? I burn to work. Come! You must have roses in your hands. I will go to the flower-sellers by the bridge.</p>
			<p class="speaker">
				<span class="character">Lucia</span>
			</p>
			<p>I would have brought them with me from the market-place⁠—one scudi each! I hesitated⁠—⁠</p>
			<p class="speaker">
				<span class="character">Paulo</span>
			</p>
			<p>And bought ten sprats instead! My wonderful, clever house-wife. Without sprats to eat I never could paint roses! But I must have them. I shall be but a moment away, my love⁠—a single moment (<span class="direction">throwing kisses from the door</span>) that will seem like years! Farewell⁠ ⁠… Little Child.</p>
			<p class="speaker">
				<span class="character">Lucia</span>
			</p>
			<p>Little Child! Ah, how I love that name, given to me with our first kiss. I love it better than my own. (<span class="direction">Thinks a moment, puzzled.</span>) For somehow it seems my <em>very</em> own⁠—⁠</p>
			<p class="speaker">
				<span class="character">Paulo</span>
			</p>
			<p>It is your own. The little love-name that seems to travel like memory up the ages. I shall be back as soon as you are ready.</p>
			<p class="direction-r">[<span class="direction">Exit</span></p>
			<p class="direction-r">[<span class="direction">Knocking at the door startles her.</span></p>

			<p class="speaker">
				<span class="character">Lucia</span>
			</p>
			<p>You! And so soon. It is <em>too</em> soon. I’ve had no time to prepare him yet⁠—⁠</p>
			<p class="speaker">
				<span class="character">Medici</span>
			</p>
			<p>A painter receives his patron without preparation surely⁠—⁠</p>
			<p class="speaker">
				<span class="character">Lucia</span>
			</p>
			<p>Patron! You must not use that word to him, or all is ruined before it is even begun. You must remember⁠—⁠</p>
			<p class="speaker">
				<span class="character">Medici</span>
			</p>
			<p>(<span class="direction">Bows ironically.</span>) “Must” to me! And “must” again! My gracious Lady Lucia forgets⁠—⁠</p>
			<p class="speaker">
				<span class="character">Lucia</span>
			</p>
			<p>Nothing. She remembers that her husband, first of all, is proud, as I have already warned you. He does not yet know that I have been to see you⁠—you, of all men in the world.</p>
			<p class="speaker">
				<span class="character">Medici</span>
			</p>
			<p>(<span class="direction">Frowning.</span>) When you say “proud” you mean, I take it, jealous.</p>
			<p class="speaker">
				<span class="character">Lucia</span>
			</p>
			<p>I mean both. (<span class="direction">Manner changing.</span>) Oh, Prince, you promised⁠—I have your word that you would be guided in this by me.</p>
			<p class="speaker">
				<span class="character">Medici</span>
			</p>
			<p>(<span class="direction">Unbending.</span>) I was in haste to see the picture⁠—⁠</p>
			<p class="speaker">
				<span class="character">Lucia</span>
			</p>
			<p>But too great haste⁠—⁠</p>
			<p class="speaker">
				<span class="character">Medici</span>
			</p>
			<p>(<span class="direction">Ignoring her interruption.</span>) For he is, I swear truly, the man I need⁠—his work, that is to say. (<span class="direction">Threateningly.</span>) As once, my Lady, you were the woman that I needed. But needs do not last for ever, nor is any indispensable⁠—perhaps.</p>
			<p class="speaker">
				<span class="character">Lucia</span>
			</p>
			<p>(<span class="direction">More control.</span>) Oh, give me time, Prince, please. You do not want to lose him. I have your word and trust it. (<span class="direction">Anxiously.</span>) Will you not take your gondola to the islands⁠—the sun is sweet upon the water⁠—and return in half an hour? I⁠—by that time I⁠⸺⁠</p>
			<p class="speaker">
				<span class="character">Medici</span>
			</p>
			<p>The light is sweet upon your face as well. What do you offer me in return for so great a favour?</p>
			<p class="speaker">
				<span class="character">Lucia</span>
			</p>
			<p>I am the wife of Paulo Salviati.</p>
			<p class="speaker">
				<span class="character">Medici</span>
			</p>
			<p>And have, as I see, married poverty as well as genius! I was too slow for once, as now, it seems, I am too hasty. I should have asked⁠—and taken⁠—all before this fellow⁠—⁠</p>
			<p class="speaker">
				<span class="character">Lucia</span>
			</p>
			<p>(<span class="direction">Scorn.</span>) Poverty with Salviati is beauty for <em>eternity</em>. The wealth of a Florentine princess belongs to <em>time</em>.</p>
			<p class="speaker">
				<span class="character">Medici</span>
			</p>
			<p>And, therefore, you come humbly to ask <em>me</em> a favour.</p>
			<p class="speaker">
				<span class="character">Lucia</span>
			</p>
			<p>One it should be an honour for you to grant (<span class="direction">with earnest persuasion</span>)⁠—that you may share in giving eternal beauty to the world. Had I asked the Collona or the Calviere to see the work of a great painter whom poverty⁠—⁠</p>
			<p class="speaker">
				<span class="character">Medici</span>
			</p>
			<p>You came, instead, to me.</p>
			<p class="speaker">
				<span class="character">Lucia</span>
			</p>
			<p>You have bought the palace on the Grand Canal and need a great⁠—the greatest⁠—painter for your ceiling⁠—-</p>
			<p class="speaker">
				<span class="character">Medici</span>
			</p>
			<p>Enthusiasm becomes you. You look divine with that passion in your eyes.</p>
			<p class="speaker">
				<span class="character">Lucia</span>
			</p>
			<p>(<span class="direction">Cunningly.</span>) I am his model too, you see.</p>
			<p class="speaker">
				<span class="character">Medici</span>
			</p>
			<p>And that delicious gesture. (<span class="direction">Steps nearer.</span>) A little more fire, a touch more of abandon, and I swear that⁠—on certain conditions⁠—oh, very small ones!⁠—I would grant everything you ask.</p>
			<p class="speaker">
				<span class="character">Lucia</span>
			</p>
			<p>(<span class="direction">Icily.</span>) An hour ago, when we talked together, you passed me your word. I appealed to you as lover of the beautiful⁠—the best, the noblest in you. I was, it seems, mistaken, and our interview now had better end. (<span class="direction">Moves to window.</span>) I will call my husband.</p>
			<p class="speaker">
				<span class="character">Medici</span>
			</p>
			<p>This change from fire to ice is exquisite! (<span class="direction">Admiringly.</span>) But why so proud, fair Lady Lucia? (<span class="direction">She stands listening.</span>) You hear him coming? (<span class="direction">She hears the water lapping. Hides her face a moment.</span>) It is only the waves. The tide is rising still. That’s all.</p>
			<p class="speaker">
				<span class="character">Lucia</span>
			</p>
			<p>(<span class="direction">Distraught.</span>) Yes, rising, rising. Please leave me, Prince. No, no⁠—please stay⁠—a moment longer. (<span class="direction">Frightened.</span>) Forgive me. Something⁠—a vision-flashed upon me out of darkness. I am confused. I fear. (<span class="direction">To herself.</span>) Oh, I have done this very thing before⁠—⁠</p>
			<p class="speaker">
				<span class="character">Medici</span>
			</p>
			<p>But not with me, alas!</p>
			<p class="speaker">
				<span class="character">Lucia</span>
			</p>
			<p>(<span class="direction">Goes to his side.</span>) Forgive me. I thought only of myself. For a moment I forgot the work, the beauty that is his divine, his holy mission. Now I’m myself again. The water, the rising water⁠—somehow⁠—in some strange way⁠—reminds me. Oh, I will be wise and loving in the noblest way. (<span class="direction">Looks into his eyes. Imploringly.</span>) It is his need, his poverty, that drive me to ask a favour of you who once aspired to be my lover. Have you no pity? We fled from Florence to escape you⁠—it is true. I would rather ask favours of any in the world but you⁠—(<span class="direction">Confused.</span>)</p>
			<p class="speaker">
				<span class="character">Medici</span>
			</p>
			<p>And yet⁠—(<span class="direction">To himself.</span>) And you are his model. You could live for ever on my ceiling! (<span class="direction">To her.</span>) You are, indeed, a Goddess belonging to eternity! (<span class="direction">Admiringly.</span>)</p>
			<p class="speaker">
				<span class="character">Lucia</span>
			</p>
			<p>And yet⁠—yes, I came to you an hour ago⁠—as patron. It is true. It was for his sake and for his great art I came. (<span class="direction">Voice singing outside.</span>) Oh, I ask no favour now more than a little time to talk with him. That is his voice. I will persuade him. I will gain his consent, and he will do the picture for you⁠—for your palace. Leave me, I beg, a few moments with him alone, and then return⁠—to find⁠—I promise it⁠—the greatest painter in all Italy⁠—⁠</p>

Even more strong than the love of a fair woman is my love of art⁠—its wonder, its beauty, and its triumph. His picture will outlive even your loveliness. (<span class="direction">Sighs.</span>) My name and my great palace will remind a later world of me, and of what I did for beauty. Well, well, my Lady Lucia, you win me over⁠—for the moment, at any rate. I will stand behind this screen and listen. I must hear how you persuade genius to abjure its principles!</p>

			<p>The husband of such beauty should be more gracious. (<span class="direction">Frankly.</span>) Ah, Salviati, you speak to a Medici, indeed, but also to one who loves beauty as you yourself do. I might⁠—had I persisted⁠—have taken your golden bird in my own net. (<span class="direction">Pauses.</span>) It is my pleasure now to set you free from the hard conditions that enslave you. In this way can a Medici reward good for evil. Signor, I forgive all for the sake of your genius. I admire your picture⁠—its true classic spirit. Yet it has not quite the warmth, the fire, the bounteous splendour we Italians ask. Give but your sky a deeper hue, add to that robe the undertone of scarlet it needs to make it felt, flood our prodigal Italian sunshine over it all⁠—and I will buy your picture at your price.</p>

			<p>Yet they would add the perfect touch now lacking⁠—in my judgment, Signor. Come, now, I will go further. I have sworn that my Palazzo shall surpass even that of Cosimo, my ambitious brother, in Florence. I will have a Gorgione for his Lippo Lippi, and⁠—if you will⁠—a Salviati for his da Vinci. I offer you, further, the painting of my ceilings, Signor⁠—seven years’ inspired and happy labour.</p>
